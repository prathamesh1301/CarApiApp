# CarApiApp
I used Retrofit to fetch information from CarsApi. Firstly,I fetched all the car names from api and arranged in a listview, added a click on listener to listview and after clicking on it, we will open up an another activity in which a image of the car and some related details will be displayed(details also from api).I used picasso library to load image in the image view.
